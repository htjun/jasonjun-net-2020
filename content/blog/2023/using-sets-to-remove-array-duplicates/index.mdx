  'Removing duplicate elements from arrays in JavaScript efficiently with Set'
---

Removing duplicates from an array is a common task in JavaScript, and there are
a few different ways to do it. One simple way is to use the `Set` object.

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. When you add a value to a set, it will
only be added if it doesn't already exist in the set. This means that if you add
an array of values to a set, any duplicates will be automatically removed.

Here's some example code:

```js
// Array with duplicates
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]

// Create a new Set from the array
const uniqueNumbers = new Set(numbers)

console.log(uniqueNumbers) // Set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
```

You can also convert the set back to an array if that's the format you need:

```js
const uniqueNumbersArray = [...uniqueNumbers]
console.log(uniqueNumbersArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

If it's a repeating task in your code, you can create a function for it:

```js
function removeDuplicates(list) {
  const set = new Set(list)
  return [...set]
}
```
