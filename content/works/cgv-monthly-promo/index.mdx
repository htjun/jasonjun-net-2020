Channel CGV is a South Korean television  owned by CJ E&M. This video is a kind of trailer bundle video produced and aired by channel CGV for promotional purposes early every month. There was a custom where one designer took charge of each month and completed the concept and production, and I was in charge of producing the video in November.
