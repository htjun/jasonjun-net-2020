Teamable is a mobile application that allows amateur athletes to easily set up matches and efficiently manage their teams.

Managing an amateur sports team is unnecessarily time-consuming. Every time a team has a game, the manager has to check which members can attend, mostly by texting or making phone calls. Setting up a game isn't easy either.

The process of designing Teamable was more iterative than incremental. We have continuosly done testing with couple of amateur football teams, and took the feedbacks from them seriously.
