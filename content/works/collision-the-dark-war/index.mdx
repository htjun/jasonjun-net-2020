This is a fake movie trailer that I made for a project in audio editing class that I took at the University of Sydney in 2013.

It was edited using video and audio from a total of 20 films, and the music is Mind Heist by Zack Hemsy. The video was edited using Adobe Premiere and the sound was edited using Sound Forge.
