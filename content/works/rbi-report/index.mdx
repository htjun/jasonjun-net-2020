RedBook Inspect is a vehicle inspection service by Carsales. They provide an inspection service, not only to individual customers, but to car dealers and finance companies. Also, a big part of the business is roadworthy inspection for drivers of ride-share services such as Uber, Ola and Didi.

The inspection report is what customers actually receive, so it's a crucial part of the business. My first project at the RBI team was to design online dynamic report to replace the existing PDF report.

The main focus of the report design was to make information accessible, readable, and fast. When there's a medium conversion from static PDF to online web page, it's easy to get too excited about possible interactions, and add a lot of interactivity to the page.

However, interactivity should be implemented only when it's necessary. And that was my intention when I was designing this dynamic report.

The service provides several types of inspection with different sets of information, and the PDF format was no longer suitable in this environment due to the lack of flexibity. The dynamic report has been structured by modular design, so the service can provide customized and even personalized reports based on different requirements.
