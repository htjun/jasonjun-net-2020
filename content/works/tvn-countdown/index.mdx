TVN is a South Korean nationwide general entertainment network owned by CJ E&M. This is a countdown video used only once at the time of the rebranding of the channel in 2011.

Producing a countdown video for the channel's rebranding launch was an impromptu idea, and therefore there was not enough time available. However, due to the severe time constraints, I was able to ignore other constraints, which allowed me to work freely and complete the work by myself from concept to completion in just one day.
